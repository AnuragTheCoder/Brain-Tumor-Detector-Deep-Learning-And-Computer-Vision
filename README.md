# ðŸ§  Brain Tumor Detection Using Deep Learning (MRI Images)

## Overview
This project implements an **automated brain tumor detection system** using **deep learning techniques** on MRI scans. It accurately identifies the presence of brain tumors, assisting medical professionals in diagnosis and treatment planning.  

---

## How It Works
The system leverages **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** to analyze MRI images and classify tumor presence. Preprocessing steps like **image normalization, resizing, and augmentation** improve model performance, while visualization tools highlight the tumor regions for interpretability.
